If you enable location tracking on your phone, the service will automatically show a detailed weather forecast for the phone’s current location.\nBy default, the app displays information about sky conditions, rainfall, temperature and wind speed and direction.\nWould you also like to see forecast information about humidity levels and wind gust speed? If so, you can adjust the app settings by tapping the icon towards the bottom of the home screen and selecting those additional parameters. They will then be displayed automatically in all forecasts.\nYou can save your favourite locations in order to consult the latest weather forecast for each one more easily. Select the locations you wish to save by tapping the search button on the top right-hand corner of the home screen and typing in the name of the city, urban district, town or rural community you want. It should appear on a drop-down menu.\nEach forecast shows expected weather conditions hour by hour for the rest of today and the next four days.\nForecasts of rainfall amount, temperature and wind speed and direction for the next five days can also be viewed as a graph. To create a graph, tap the graph button at the top of the forecast table and select the weather parameter that you wish to view.\nThe animation in the map section of the app shows where rainfall is expected to occur in Jamaica during the next few hours.\nIn addition to weather forecasts, the app shows all weather warnings that are in force in Jamaica over the next five days. The warnings section contains a series of five warnings maps of the island and the surrounding sea area. Each map shows all the weather warnings that have been issued by the Meteorological Service of Jamaica for that particular day.\nThe text section below each map provides more detailed information about each warning shown on the map on a parish-by-parish basis. Each warning message describes the threat expected, the level of severity anticipated and the kind of impacts that are likely."
